# youtube_api
get DataFrame of videos you interested in and it's comments with replies in second DataFrame for further analysis
you need to have your own youtube API_KEY for this code to work
you can easily get it from https://console.cloud.google.com
If you are going to use youtube api once or twice i recommend you to not use Oauth 2.0 and just get api_key
Also, problems may arise depending on how many videos and comments you are going to get. You may run out of quotas, which you can also get from https://console.cloud.google.com
